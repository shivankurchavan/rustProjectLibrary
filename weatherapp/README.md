# Weather App

A simple weather forecasting application built in Rust. This app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current temperature and weather description for a specified city.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays temperature and weather description.
- Uses environment variables to securely manage the API key.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (version 1.56 or higher) must be installed on your machine. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weatherapp
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

3. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```

## Project Structure

```
weatherapp/          # Root folder
├── src/             # Source code folder
│   ├── main.rs      # Main file where the application logic resides
│   └── api.rs       # Handles API request logic
├── .env             # Contains the API key (ignored by Git)
├── Cargo.toml       # Project's configuration file (dependencies, metadata)
└── target/          # Compiled output (auto-generated by Cargo)
```

## Running the Application

Ensure you have your API key set in the `.env` file.

Run the application:

```bash
cargo run
```

The app will output the current temperature and weather description for the specified city (default is New York).

## Code Overview

### main.rs

The entry point of the application that:

- Loads environment variables from the `.env` file.
- Fetches the weather data using the `get_forecast` function from `api.rs`.
- Displays the current temperature and weather description.

### api.rs

Contains the API call logic:

- Defines the data structures used to deserialize the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Implements the `get_forecast` function that fetches weather data for a specified city.

## Environment Variables

The application uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information such as the API key. The `.env` file should not be committed to version control. Ensure that your `.gitignore` includes:

```bash
.env
```
